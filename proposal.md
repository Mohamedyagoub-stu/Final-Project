# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Daily Habit Tracker

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A daily habit tracker that gets the user addicted to hitting their goals every day uses a streak feature similar to the Apple Watch Rings.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The Daily Habit Tracker is gonna be a simple program that helps users track their daily habits and keep streaks going to stay motivated. It’ll have a basic interface where users can add, edit, delete, and view their habits. The main feature is a streak tracker, kinda like the Apple Watch Rings, that shows progress visually. It’ll also have a progress calendar, daily reminders, and summaries to help users see how they’re doing over time. I’m planning to use Python libraries like tkinter for the interface and json or csv for saving data.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

n/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I’ll build a working habit tracker with a simple interface where you can add, edit, delete, and view habits. Data will be stored locally using json or csv.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Add features like streak tracking, daily reminders, and a progress calendar. Also, let users see their habit streaks and get progress summaries.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Include more advanced features like data analysis tools, customization options (themes, categories), and exportable progress reports.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next, I need to learn how to build a graphical user interface using tkinter or something similar. I also have to figure out how to save and load data with json or csv to keep track of user progress. My plan is to start by building different parts of the program, like adding and editing habits, before putting everything together. If I have time, I’ll try to add some basic stats or graphs to show progress and make the tracker more useful.
