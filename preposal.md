# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Since I like to journal and fill out weekly goals, I wanted to do a goal/habit tracker. That is a bit complex but another simpler idea I had was being able to either figure out how many calories someone would need to burn to lose weight or how many calories they would need to eat to be in a deficit.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No, it's a solo project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

n/a.
